Apple Inc., led by CEO Tim Cook, announced its quarterly earnings yesterday, reporting a revenue of over $90 billion. The results, exceeding analyst expectations from Wall Street, were largely driven by strong iPhone sales in Europe and Asia, particularly in China. The announcement was made from their headquarters in Cupertino, California. Despite global economic headwinds, Apple plans to invest 10% more in R&D during the next fiscal year, starting in October 2024. Mr. Cook mentioned that future products might leverage technologies developed by DeepMind, a Google subsidiary based in London, although no specific partnership was confirmed.
