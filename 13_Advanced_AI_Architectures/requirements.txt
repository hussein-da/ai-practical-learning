# Module 13: Advanced AI Architectures
# This module is conceptual and does not require specific Python packages.
# Building and training Transformers, GANs, etc., typically requires deep learning frameworks
# like TensorFlow/Keras (tensorflow) or PyTorch (torch), along with other libraries
# such as transformers (from Hugging Face), numpy, matplotlib, etc., depending on the task.
