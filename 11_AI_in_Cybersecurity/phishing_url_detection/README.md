# Phishing URL Detection with Machine Learning\n\nThis sub-module provides a conceptual overview of using Machine Learning (ML) to detect phishing URLs.\n\n## Introduction to Phishing Detection\n\nPhishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate individuals or organizations to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, credit card numbers) or installing malware. Phishing attacks are commonly initiated through emails, messages, or malicious websites with deceptive URLs.\n\nML can be used to analyze URLs and website content to identify characteristics indicative of phishing attempts.\n\n**Key Concepts for URL-based Phishing Detection:**\n\n*   **Lexical Features:** Analyzing the URL string itself (e.g., length of URL, presence of special characters like '@', number of dots, use of IP addresses instead of domain names, presence of suspicious keywords like 'login', 'update', 'verify').\n*   **Host-based Features:** Examining properties of the URL's host (e.g., WHOIS information, domain age, SSL certificate validity, DNS records, geographic location of the server). Requires external lookups.\n*   **Content-based Features (More Advanced):** Analyzing the HTML content of the webpage linked by the URL (e.g., presence of forms, suspicious JavaScript, iframes, similarity to known legitimate sites). Requires fetching and parsing web content.\n*   **Blacklists/Whitelists:** Using lists of known phishing or legitimate URLs (e.g., PhishTank, Google Safe Browsing). ML can complement these lists.\n\nFor simplicity, our conceptual example will focus primarily on **lexical features** that can be extracted directly from the URL string.\n\n## Conceptual Python Example (`conceptual_phishing_detector.py`)\n\nThe provided `conceptual_phishing_detector.py` script demonstrates a highly simplified workflow for phishing URL detection using lexical features:\n\n1.  **Loading Data:** It loads a small sample CSV (`sample_urls.csv`) containing a few URLs labeled as 'phishing' or 'legitimate'.\n2.  **Feature Extraction:** It defines functions to extract very basic lexical features from each URL (e.g., URL length, count of dots, presence of '@' symbol, checks if an IP address is used as the hostname).\n3.  **Vectorization:** These features are converted into a numerical format suitable for ML models.\n4.  **Model Training:** It trains a simple `LogisticRegression` model from `scikit-learn`. In practice, other models like SVMs, Random Forests, or Naive Bayes might be used.\n5.  **Prediction:** It makes predictions on the sample data.\n6.  **Evaluation (Basic):** It prints a simple accuracy score and classification report.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This script is **highly conceptual** and for illustrative purposes only. Real-world phishing detection systems are far more sophisticated and would:\n    *   Utilize a much richer set of lexical, host-based, and potentially content-based features.\n    *   Employ more advanced feature engineering and NLP techniques.\n    *   Be trained on vast, constantly updated datasets of phishing and legitimate URLs.\n    *   Integrate with real-time blacklists and threat intelligence feeds.\n    *   Focus heavily on minimizing false positives (wrongly blocking legitimate sites) and false negatives (missing actual phishing sites).\n
## Setup & Running the Conceptual Script\n\n1.  **Navigate to this directory:**\n    ```bash\n    cd 11_AI_in_Cybersecurity/phishing_url_detection/\n    ```\n2.  **Create/Activate Python Virtual Environment:** (If not already done from the parent module)\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv venv_phish\n    # macOS/Linux: source venv_phish/bin/activate\n    # Windows: venv_phish\\Scripts\\activate\n    ```\n3.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n4.  **Run the script:**\n    ```bash\n    python conceptual_phishing_detector.py\n    ```\nYou should see output showing the extracted features, model training confirmation, predictions, and a simple evaluation.\n\n## Further Exploration\n\n*   Research common lexical features used in phishing detection (e.g., using `tldextract` for domain/subdomain analysis, checking for common brand names, analyzing URL path structure).\n*   Explore APIs for host-based features (e.g., WHOIS Python libraries, DNS query libraries).\n*   Investigate how content-based features can be extracted (e.g., using `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing, TF-IDF for text content).\n*   Consider the importance of dataset freshness in phishing detection, as phishing campaigns are often short-lived.\n
