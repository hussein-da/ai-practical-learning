# Conceptual Dockerfile for a Python Flask ML Model API
# This is an illustrative example. You would need to adapt it for your specific model,
# application code, and dependencies.

# === Stage 1: Define Base Image ===
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image.
# Choose a specific version for reproducibility (e.g., 3.9-slim for a smaller image).
FROM python:3.9-slim-bullseye

# === Environment Variables ===
# Set environment variables to configure the container environment.
# PYTHONUNBUFFERED ensures that Python output is sent straight to the terminal
# without being buffered first, which is useful for logging.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
# PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR disables the pip cache to reduce image size.
ENV PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off
# PORT for the Flask application to run on inside the container.
ENV APP_PORT=5000

# === Set Working Directory ===
# Sets the working directory for any subsequent RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, ADD commands.
WORKDIR /app

# === Install System Dependencies (if any) ===
# For example, if your application or a Python library needs system-level packages.
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
#     gcc \
#     libpq-dev \
#  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# (This example is commented out as it depends on specific needs)

# === Copy Application Dependencies ===
# Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker layer caching.
# If requirements.txt hasn't changed, Docker can reuse this layer.
COPY ./conceptual_requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# === Install Python Dependencies ===
# Install the Python dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# === Copy Application Code and Model ===
# Copy the rest of your application source code and ML model into the container.
# Assuming your Flask app is in a 'src' directory and model in a 'models' directory.
COPY ./conceptual_src/ /app/src/
COPY ./conceptual_model/ /app/model/
# If you had static files or templates for Flask, you'd copy them too:
# COPY ./static /app/static/
# COPY ./templates /app/templates/

# === Expose Port ===
# Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port at runtime.
# This does not actually publish the port. You do that when you run `docker run -p`.
EXPOSE ${APP_PORT}

# === Define Entrypoint or CMD ===
# This is the command that will be executed when the container starts.
# For a Flask app, you typically use `gunicorn` for a production-ready WSGI server,
# or `flask run` for development.

# Example using Flask's built-in server (more for development/simplicity):
# CMD ["python", "./src/app.py"]

# Example using Gunicorn (a common production WSGI server for Python web apps):
# CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "src.app:app"]
# (Assumes your Flask app object is named 'app' in 'src/app.py')

# For this conceptual example, we'll just echo a message.
# In a real scenario, this would be the command to start your ML model serving application.
CMD echo "Conceptual ML Model Container. To run, replace this CMD with your application start command (e.g., gunicorn, flask run, or your custom script)."

# === Healthcheck (Optional but Recommended) ===
# Defines how to test a container's health to ensure it's working.
# For a web service, this might involve curling a health endpoint.
# HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
#   CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || exit 1
# (Commented out as it requires a /health endpoint in your app)

# === User (Optional Best Practice) ===
# Running as a non-root user is a security best practice.
# RUN useradd --create-home appuser
# USER appuser

# === Labels (Optional Metadata) ===
# Add metadata to an image using LABEL instructions.
# LABEL version="1.0"
# LABEL description="Conceptual ML Model Serving API"
# LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"
