# Conceptual Guide: Fine-tuning Mistral Models

This guide outlines the conceptual steps and code structure for fine-tuning open-source Mistral models (e.g., Mistral-7B) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically QLoRA.

**Disclaimer:** This guide and the accompanying script (`conceptual_finetune_script.py`) are illustrative. Actual fine-tuning requires a suitable GPU environment (significant VRAM), a properly formatted dataset, and careful hyperparameter tuning. **The provided script is not runnable without these prerequisites.**

## Fine-tuning Goal

To adapt a pre-trained Mistral base model to better follow specific instructions or perform well on a custom dataset, using memory-efficient QLoRA.

## Key Steps Involved

1.  **Environment Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`transformers`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`, `datasets`, `torch`). This often requires specific CUDA versions.
2.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Create or obtain a dataset suitable for instruction fine-tuning.
    *   Format the data, typically in JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) format.
A common format follows the structure used by models like Alpaca, often including special tokens to delineate instructions and responses:
        ```json
        {"text": "<s>[INST] Your instruction or question here [/INST] The desired model response here </s>"}
        {"text": "<s>[INST] Another instruction [/INST] Another response </s>"}
        ```
    *   See `sample_data.jsonl` for a minimal example.
3.  **Model & Tokenizer Loading:**
    *   Load the base Mistral model (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`) using `transformers`.
    *   Load the corresponding tokenizer.
    *   Configure quantization (e.g., 4-bit) using `BitsAndBytesConfig` from `transformers` to enable QLoRA and reduce memory usage.
4.  **PEFT Configuration (QLoRA):**
    *   Define a `LoraConfig` from the `peft` library.
    *   Specify parameters like `r` (rank), `lora_alpha`, `target_modules` (which layers to apply LoRA to, often attention layers like `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`), `lora_dropout`, `bias`.
    *   Wrap the quantized base model with `get_peft_model` to prepare it for LoRA training.
5.  **Dataset Loading & Processing:**
    *   Load the formatted dataset using the `datasets` library.
    *   (Optional) Pre-process or tokenize the data if needed, though the `Trainer` can often handle this.
6.  **Training Setup (`transformers.Trainer`):**
    *   Define `TrainingArguments` specifying output directories, batch sizes (per device), gradient accumulation steps, learning rate, number of epochs, logging steps, saving strategy, optimizer choice (e.g., `paged_adamw_8bit`), learning rate scheduler, etc.
    *   Initialize the `Trainer` with the PEFT model, training arguments, dataset, tokenizer, and potentially data collators.
7.  **Running Training (Conceptual):**
    *   Call `trainer.train()`.
    *   **This is the compute-intensive step requiring GPUs.**
    *   Monitor training progress (loss) using logs or integrated tools (like Weights & Biases, TensorBoard).
8.  **Saving the Adapter:**
    *   After training, save the trained LoRA adapter weights using `trainer.save_model()` or `model.save_pretrained()`.
    *   Only the small adapter weights are saved, not the entire base model.
9.  **Inference with Fine-tuned Adapter:**
    *   Load the original base model (potentially quantized again for inference).
    *   Load the trained LoRA adapter weights from the saved directory using `PeftModel.from_pretrained()`.
    *   (Optional but recommended) Merge the adapter weights into the base model for potentially faster inference using `model.merge_and_unload()`.
    *   Use the merged model with the `transformers` pipeline or `generate()` method for inference.

## Conceptual Script

See `conceptual_finetune_script.py` for a Python script structure that outlines these steps using Hugging Face libraries. Remember, it's heavily commented and requires modification/setup to run.

## Necessary Libraries

Ensure the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in a compatible Python environment with the correct PyTorch and CUDA versions.
