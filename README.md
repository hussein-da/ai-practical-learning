# AI Practical Learning Modules\n\n**A Comprehensive Learning Repository by Hussein Daoud** ([https://github.com/hussein-da](https://github.com/hussein-da))\n\nWelcome! This repository offers a collection of 15 hands-on and conceptual learning modules designed to cover a wide spectrum of Artificial Intelligence topics, from foundational concepts to advanced architectures and deployment practices.\n\n## üéØ Project Goal\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to provide structured, practical learning materials for individuals looking to deepen their understanding and skills in various areas of AI. Each module aims to be relatively self-contained, offering explanations, code examples (where applicable), and resources to explore specific AI concepts and techniques.\n
## üóÇÔ∏è Module Overview\n
This repository is organized into the following 15 modules:\n
1.  **[01_RAG_FAQ_Chatbot](./01_RAG_FAQ_Chatbot/)**: Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for answering questions based on a provided knowledge base (FAQ dataset).\n2.  **[02_Prompt_Engineering](./02_Prompt_Engineering/)**: Techniques for designing effective prompts to interact with large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n3.  **[03_Vector_Databases](./03_Vector_Databases/)**: Introduction to vector databases (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant) for efficient similarity search in AI applications. *(Note: Example Python scripts are currently missing due to generation issues).*\n4.  **[04_Microservices_with_AI](./04_Microservices_with_AI/)**: Creating a simple AI-powered microservice (Sentiment Analysis API) using Flask and Docker.\n5.  **[05_Low_Code_No_Code_AI](./05_Low_Code_No_Code_AI/)**: Conceptual overview of using Low-Code/No-Code platforms (Bubble.io, Zapier) to build AI-driven applications and automations.\n6.  **[06_Practical_NLP_Applications](./06_Practical_NLP_Applications/)**: Hands-on examples of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Text Classification.\n7.  **[07_LLM_Knowledge_Base](./07_LLM_Knowledge_Base/)**: Building a simple knowledge base application using Streamlit and an LLM for querying content.\n8.  **[08_Fine_tuning_LLMs](./08_Fine_tuning_LLMs/)**: Conceptual guide to fine-tuning smaller LLMs (like Mistral) on custom datasets for specific tasks. *(Note: Llama subdirectory intentionally skipped).*\n9.  **[09_Mobile_Apps_with_AI](./09_Mobile_Apps_with_AI/)**: Conceptual guide to integrating AI features into mobile apps using React Native and backend APIs.\n10. **[10_Real_Time_Data_Pipelines](./10_Real_Time_Data_Pipelines/)**: Implementing a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using Apache Kafka and Python (NLTK/VADER).\n11. **[11_AI_in_Cybersecurity](./11_AI_in_Cybersecurity/)**: Conceptual examples of using AI for Network Intrusion Detection and Phishing URL Detection.\n12. **[12_AI_Ethics_and_Responsible_AI](./12_AI_Ethics_and_Responsible_AI/)**: Discussing the crucial topics of AI Ethics, Bias, Explainability (XAI), and Privacy.\n13. **[13_Advanced_AI_Architectures](./13_Advanced_AI_Architectures/)**: Conceptual overview of advanced architectures like Transformers, GANs, Diffusion Models, and GNNs.\n14. **[14_Deploying_AI_Models_MLOps](./14_Deploying_AI_Models_MLOps/)**: Introduction to MLOps principles, including model packaging, containerization (Docker), deployment strategies, monitoring, and retraining.\n15. **[15_The_Future_of_AI_and_Next_Steps_in_Learning](./15_The_Future_of_AI_and_Next_Steps_in_Learning/)**: A look at current AI trends, potential future directions, and advice for continued learning.\n
## üìñ How to Use This Repository\n
1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/hussein-da/ai-practical-learning.git` (Replace with your actual repo URL after creating it on GitHub)\n2.  **Navigate to a Module:** Change into the directory of the module you are interested in (e.g., `cd 01_RAG_FAQ_Chatbot`).\n3.  **Follow Module README:** Each module directory contains its own `README.md` file with specific instructions, prerequisites, setup steps, and explanations for that topic.\n4.  **Virtual Environments:** For modules with Python code, it is highly recommended to create and activate a Python virtual environment within the module\'s directory before installing dependencies.\n5.  **Install Dependencies:** Use the `requirements.txt` file provided within each relevant module to install necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n6.  **Conceptual Modules:** Modules covering advanced topics or areas like Ethics and MLOps (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15) are primarily conceptual and contain detailed READMEs for learning rather than runnable code.\n
## ‚öôÔ∏è General Prerequisites\n
While specific prerequisites vary by module, a general familiarity with the following is beneficial:\n
*   **Python:** Basic to intermediate programming skills.\n*   **Command Line/Terminal:** Basic navigation and execution of commands.\n*   **Pip:** Python package manager.\n*   **Git & GitHub:** Basic version control concepts.\n*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** Required for modules involving containerization (e.g., 01, 04, 07, 10, conceptually in 14).\n*   **Fundamental AI/ML Concepts:** A basic understanding of machine learning principles is helpful but modules aim to be accessible.\n
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes\n
*   **Conceptual Nature:** Many modules, especially those dealing with complex setups (fine-tuning, advanced architectures, mobile apps) or broad topics (ethics, MLOps), provide conceptual guides and illustrative examples rather than fully production-ready code.\n*   **Known Issues:** As noted above, the Python code examples for Module 3 (Vector Databases) are currently missing.\n*   **API Keys:** Some modules require API keys (e.g., for OpenAI, Pinecone). Remember to handle these securely and **never commit them directly** to your repository. Use environment variables or `.env` files (and add `.env` to your `.gitignore`).\n
