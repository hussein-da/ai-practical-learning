# Module 10: Real-Time Data Pipelines with AI

**A Learning Guide by Hussein Daoud** ([https://github.com/hussein-da](https://github.com/hussein-da))

This module explores the construction of **Real-Time Data Pipelines** that incorporate AI models for instantaneous analysis and decision-making. We will focus on building a pipeline for real-time sentiment tracking of a text stream using Apache Kafka and TensorFlow/Transformers.

## 🚀 Introduction: Processing Data Streams with AI

In many modern applications, data arrives continuously as streams (e.g., social media feeds, sensor data, application logs, financial transactions). Real-time AI pipelines are designed to process this data as it arrives, apply AI models for tasks like classification, anomaly detection, or prediction, and potentially trigger immediate actions.

**Key Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion/Producer:** The source of the data stream (e.g., monitoring an API, reading from sensors).
*   **Message Broker:** A system to handle the high volume and velocity of streaming data, decoupling producers from consumers (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar, AWS Kinesis).
*   **Stream Processor/Consumer:** Reads data from the broker, processes it (potentially applying transformations), and runs AI model inference.
*   **AI Model:** The trained model performing the desired task (e.g., sentiment analysis, fraud detection).
*   **Output/Sink:** Where the results of the AI analysis are sent (e.g., a database, dashboard, alerting system).

**Benefits:**

*   **Timeliness:** Gain insights and react to events as they happen.
*   **Scalability:** Message brokers and distributed stream processors allow the pipeline to handle large data volumes.
*   **Decoupling:** Producers and consumers operate independently.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the architecture of a typical real-time AI data pipeline.
*   Recognize the role of a message broker like Apache Kafka.
*   Set up a basic Kafka instance using Docker Compose.
*   Develop a Python script to produce messages to a Kafka topic.
*   Develop a Python script to consume messages from Kafka.
*   Integrate a pre-trained AI model (TensorFlow/Keras or Hugging Face Transformers) into the consumer for real-time inference (sentiment analysis).
*   Understand the flow of data from producer to AI-analyzed output.

## 🛠️ Module Structure: Kafka & TensorFlow/Transformers Sentiment Pipeline

We will implement a pipeline where a producer simulates text messages, sends them to Kafka, and a consumer reads them, performs sentiment analysis, and prints the results.
